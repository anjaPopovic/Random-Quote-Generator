# Random-Quote-Generator

## Description
The **Random Quote Generator** is a simple web application that displays a random inspirational quote each time the user clicks the "Show another quote" button. The background color of the page changes with each new quote to add visual interest.

## Features
- Display a random quote with the author's name.
- Change the background color with each new quote.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic content generation and interactivity.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file used for styling the page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that controls the dynamic content of the page.

## How It Works
- The `quotes` array in the `script.js` file contains a collection of quotes and their respective authors.
- The `getRandomQuote()` function selects a random quote from the array.
- The `showRandomQuote()` function updates the HTML content with the selected quote and changes the background color using the `getRandomColor()` function.
